check newObject is either front or back side of the hyperplane.
front side is that, where origin exist and overlap to hyperplane.

to check that consider a line from origin to location of newObject.
Line = new Line( origin, newObject.position )

if this line intersecting the hyperplane then newObject is in back side, otherwise in front side.


Result = 'front side'
if HyperPlane.intersectLine( Line ) == null  // return intersection point or null
	Result = 'back side'
